# 🌌 Cosmic Voice-Command Nebula

An interactive, high-performance 3D generative art piece built with **Three.js**. This project uses the **Web Speech API** and **Web Audio API** to transform your voice and music into a living, morphing galaxy of 30,000 particles.



## 🚀 Key Features

* **🎙️ Voice-Activated Morphing**: Real-time speech recognition allows the nebula to change into 10 distinct shapes based on specific keywords.
* **🔊 Audio-Reactive "Echo"**: Particles possess "Echo Environment" physics—they vibrate and jitter in response to your voice volume and background music frequencies.
* **✨ Cinematic Visuals**: High-fidelity bloom, additive blending, and color-lerping transitions create an ethereal, cosmic atmosphere.
* **🖱️ Orbital Control**: Fully interactive camera allowing users to zoom and rotate around the 3D structures.
