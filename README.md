#**Core Features**
Audio-Reactive Engine: Uses the Web Audio API to analyze Bass, Mids, and Treble in real-time.

Bass drives the heartbeat and formation speed.

Mids influence the density and "glow" of the nebula cloud.

Treble triggers rapid color cycling and lens distortion.

#**Interactive Physics**:

Vortex Mode: Particles swirl into a spiral galaxy based on audio intensity.

Mouse Gravity: Users can warp space by moving their cursor, repelling or attracting cosmic dust.

Cinematic Post-Processing: Utilizes UnrealBloomPass for ethereal glows and custom ShaderPass for chromatic aberration (lens bleeding).

High Performance: Optimized particle rendering using BufferGeometry to ensure smooth 60FPS performance on modern browsers.

#**Tech Stack**
Language: JavaScript (ES6+ Modules)

Library: Three.js (WebGL)

Audio: Web Audio API (AnalyserNode)

Styling: CSS3 (Glassmorphism & Neon UI)
